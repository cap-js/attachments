### Attachments sample

This repository contains a sample CDS model extensions to demonstrate the CDS plugin [@cap-js/attachments](https://github.com/cap-js/attachments) on the [Incidents Management](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app) reference app for the new reuse types `Attachments` and `Image`.

### Setup

For the AWS S3 Object store sample, we have already prepared a service instance with a bucket which you can access. To access it, follow this setup.

1. Log in to Cloud Foundry:

    ```sh
    cf login -a https://api.cf.eu12.hana.ondemand.com -o cap-enablement-team -s samples
    ```

2.  If you have clone this repository the first time and did not bind to the service (no _.cdsrc-private.json_ file), continue with the steps below.
    In this directory (_services/attachments/_), you can generate a new file _.cdsrc-private.json by running:

    ```sh
    cds bind @cap-js/attachments -2 attachments-sample:attachments-sample-key --kind s3
    ```
