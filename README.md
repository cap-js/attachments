# Attachments Plugin for SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/cap-js/change-tracking)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/cap-js/attachments)

The `@cap-js/attachments` package is a [CDS plugin](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-plugins#cds-plugin-packages) providing out-of-the box asset storage and handling by using a predefined *type* `Image` or *entity* `Attachments`. It also provides a CAP-level, easy to use integration of the Document Service/Object Store.

1. [Install the plugin: `npm add @cap-js/attachments`](#setup)
2. [Add `Image` or `Attachments` types to your CDS models](#annotations)

## Preliminaries

In this guide, we use the [Incidents Management reference sample app](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app) as the base to add attachments to. Clone the repository and apply the step-by-step instructions:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app
cd incidents-app
npm i
```

> [!Important]
> To be able to use the Fiori *uploadTable* feature, you must include the following SAPUI5 version in _incidents-app/app/incidents/webapp/index.html_ at line 15:
```diff
-        src="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.120.0/resources/sap-ui-core.js"
+        src="https://sapui5untested.int.sap.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js"
```

> [!Note]
> For running the *hybrid* scenario, you must first [create a _.cdsrc-private.json_](./xmpl/README.md#setup) once.


## Setup

To enable automatic asset handling, simply add this self-configuring plugin package to your project:

```sh
npm add @cap-js/attachments
```

## Annotations

All we need to do is to denote the respective asset elements with *type* `Image` or `Attachments`. Following the [best practice of separation of concerns](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/domain-modeling#separation-of-concerns), we do so in a separate file _srv/attachments.cds_:

```cds
using { sap.capire.incidents as my } from '@capire/incidents/db/schema';
using { Image, Attachments } from '@cap-js/attachments';

extend my.Incidents with { attachments: Attachments }
extend my.Customers with { avatar: Image }
```

...


## Test-drive locally

With the steps above, we have successfully set up asset handling for our reference application. Let's see that in action.
We can try out two difference scenarios, (i) the *default* scenario where the image/attachments contents are stored locally in the database and (ii) the *hybrid* scenario where the contents are stored in an AWS S3 bucket.

1. **Start the server**:
  - *Default* scenario (In memory database):
      ```sh
      cds watch
      ```
  - *Hybrid* scenario (AWS S3):
      ```sh
      cds watch --profile hybrid
      ```
      You can verify that your service bindings setup was successful by checking for the following in your output:

      ```
      resolving cloud service bindings...
      bound @cap-js/attachments to Cloud Foundry managed service attachments-sample:attachments-sample-key
      ```

2. **Navigate to the object page** of the closed incident:

    Go to [Object page for incident **Inverter not functional**](http://localhost:4004/incidents/#/Incidents(ID=3b23bb4b-4ac7-4a24-ac02-aa10cabd842c,IsActiveEntity=true))

3. The `Image` annotation enabled us to show the customer's avatar in the header next to their name (see 1), while the `Attachments` annotation has generated an out-of-the-box Attachments table (see 2) at the bottom of the Object page:

    ![Customers with Image](./etc/facet.png)

4. **Navigate to the object page** of the first open incident:

    Go to [Object page for incident **Solar panel broken**](http://localhost:4004/incidents/#/Incidents(ID=3583f982-d7df-4aad-ab26-301d4a157cd7,IsActiveEntity=true))

    **Upload a file** by going into Edit mode and either using the **Upload** button on the Attachments table or by drag/drop. Then click the **Save** button to have that file stored that file in the dedicated resource (database, S3 bucket, etc.). We demonstrate this my uploading the PDF file from [_xmpl/db/content/Solar Panel Report.pdf_](./xmpl/db/content/Solar%20Panel%20Report.pdf):
